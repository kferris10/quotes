#### [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2018)

> [In my 60s] of course I still assess the quality of my work. But I also ask myself a whole other set of questions about my life. Did I devote enough time to my family? Did I learn enough new things? Did I develop new friendships and deepen old ones? These would have been laughable to me when I was 25, but as I get older, they are much more meaningful.
> 
> Melinda has helped broaden my thinking on this point. So has Warren Buffett, who says his measure of success is, “Do the people you care about love you back?” I think that is about as good a metric as you will find.

> In the United States every year, there are roughly 30,000 fatalities from automobile accidents. That is a benchmark.

It’s the third leading cause of death in the United States, right behind cancer and heart disease.

#### [Rubin](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/19/magazine/keeping-the-boom-from-busting.html)

> It was during these years, he says, that he learned to think about life ''probabilistically.'' That is, Rubin came to believe that while no one can predict the future, it is possible to assess the odds of various futures. ''At Harvard and Yale Law School I learned to think about the uncertainties and the ambiguities of life intellectually,'' he says. ''When I got to Goldman, Sachs, I learned it was a matter of financial life and death to learn to be probabilistic. If you thought in absolutes and black-and-whites, sooner or later you got wiped out. The odds would catch up with you.''

> ''We had one month in which we lost more money than the firm made in any prior year,'' he remembers. ''But most people had internalized this sort of thing and the senior management, particularly, was very good about saying, Look we understand once in a while things like this will happen. It doesn't mean people weren't nervous because they were -- hell, I was nervous.''
